# Hawai'i Trails

## Commit History
The project was started in two other repositories as we were testing things out and didn't want to mess up this repo. We couldn't transfer the commit history over so they can be found in the links below.

The frontend commits can be found at [https://github.com/janeligio/hawaii-trails](https://github.com/janeligio/hawaii-trails).

The backend commits can be found at [https://github.com/joshuahartmann/hawaii-trails-api](https://github.com/joshuahartmann/hawaii-trails-api).

## Clone Repository
To clone the repository you will need to first make sure you have the latest version of [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) installed.

- You can check if you have then installed by typing
- `node --version` > v14.17.1
- `yarn --version` > 1.17.3

Then use the following command to clone the repository.
- `git clone https://github.com/HACC2021/HawaiiTrails.git`

## Install Dependencies

### Backend
From the top-level directory
- `cd backend`
- `npm i`

### Frontend
From the top-level directory

## Running the Program Locally
You will first need to run the backend code before the frontend.

Make sure you are in the top-level directory before running these commands.

To start the server
- `cd backend`
- `npm start`

To start the frontend
- `cd frontend`
- `yarn start`

The application should open up at http://localhost:3000, if it doesn't you may need to type it into the address bar.
